To ensure the accuracy of EEG signals in emotion recognition, the original EEG data was cleaned. Bandpass filtering, notch filtering and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to clean the signals. 20w+ EEG data were successfully optimized to provide reliable input for subsequent emotion classification model training.
â€¢ To analyze brain wave signals and realize automatic emotion classification. Based on the Mamba model, residual connections were introduced and two convolutional layers, time and space, were combined to optimize the structure of the emotion classification model, and the final classification accuracy reached 97.8%. The application effect of EEG signals in emotion recognition tasks was significantly improved.
